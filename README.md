This series of codes takes a suite of data sets (i.e., longitudinal river profiles, cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations, marine terrace rock uplift calculations, and low-temperature thermochronometric ages) and uses a Bayesian inversion to constrain rock uplift histories and parameters in the detachment-limited stream power model.

These codes are modified versions of the algorithm described in Glotzbach (2015). The version of the codes in this repository was applied in Gallen et al. (2023). Please see those references for details on the model.

The three example scripts provided will run an abbreviated simulation using the datasets in Gallen et al. (2023). Note that the data provided with the examples was prepared using SRTM digital elevation models and TopoToolbox v2 (Schwanghart and Scherler, 2014).

If you use these codes of modified versions of these codes for scientific research, please cite Glotzbach (2015) and Gallen et al. (2023).
